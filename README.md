# Lock picks

## TLDR

This is a package that allows you to disable ALL locks that another author might have imposed
on code you use in your project. It contains some tools that I use for years now and work quite well.

## WARNING

- Expect there to be a LOT of reflection and string manipulation happening ðŸ™ˆ
- If you break open third-party code be sure that **YOU KNOW** what you are doing, and that the code might change and so
  your code needs to be flexible enough not to break.

## Rambling

While I understand why principles like SOLID exist, and why you can easily get in trouble if you start to modify
third-party code. In a day-to-day basis, where you need to find solutions; `private` and `final` are two words that
bring
me to the brink of cringe every time I see them. Making something private AND final in code other developers might use
is like locking someone into a room without lights, windows and a door they could use to do their job. If you as an
author use
`protected` and someone modifies that code, without it being clearly marked as "@api" it should be fairly clear that
there might be dragons. But, please, please guys and gals all around the world,
don't take away the option from others to fix a bug, or extend a feature you did.

## Installation

Install this package using composer:

```
composer require neunerlei/lockpick
```

## What's in the box

### Class lock-pick

The `Neunerlei\Lockpick\Util\ClassLockpick` class is minimal invasive tool to do stuff with objects that are locked for
extension. For example, if there is a private property you want to get the data from, or call a private method.
The usage is simple and comes with minimal overhead:

```php
<?php

use Neunerlei\Lockpick\Util\ClassLockpick;

class LockedClass {
    private static int $staticProperty = 0;
    private int $property = 1;
    
    private function foo(string $name): string{
        return sprintf('hello %s', $name);
    }
    
    private static function staticFoo(): string {
        return 'I am static!';
    }
}

$i = new LockedClass();

// Create a lock-pick instance for the class
$lp = new ClassLockpick($i);

// Check if the property exists
if($lp->hasProperty('property')){
    // Use one of the utility methods
    echo $lp->getPropertyValue('property'); // 1
    
    // You can set the value in the same way
    $lp->setPropertyValue('property', 3);
    
    // Alternatively you can use the "magic" approach
    echo $lp->property; // 3
    $lp->property = 5;
    echo $lp->property; // 5
}

// You can do the same for methods
if($lp->hasMethod('foo')){
    // You can also run parameters in it
    echo $lp->runMethod('foo', ['bar']); // 'hello bar'
    
    // You can also apply a bit of sugar here
    echo $lp->foo('bar'); // 'hello bar'
}

// Of course, this also works for statics
if(ClassLockpick::hasStaticProperty(LockedClass::class, 'staticProperty')){
    echo ClassLockpick::getStaticPropertyValue(LockedClass::class, 'staticProperty'); // 0;
    ClassLockpick::setStaticPropertyValue(LockedClass::class, 'staticProperty' 2);
    echo ClassLockpick::getStaticPropertyValue(LockedClass::class, 'staticProperty'); // 2;
}

// This will work for methods as well
if(ClassLockpick::hasStaticMethod(LockedClass::class, 'staticFoo')){
    echo ClassLockpick::runStaticMethod(LockedClass::class, 'staticFoo'); // 'I am static'
}
```

#### A word of advice

While it is possible to use the `ClassLockpick`, you should always ask yourself if it is really needed.
If you want to access a protected property or a method on another object, you can always use an adapter class,
like this:

```php
<?php

class SomeClass {
    protected int $property = 1;
    
    protected function method(): string{
        return 'hello';
    }
}

class SomeClassAdapter extends SomeClass {
    public static function getInstanceProperty(SomeClass $instance): int {
        return $instance->property;
    }
    
    public static function runInstanceMethod(SomeClass $instance): string {
        return $instance->method();
    }
}

$i = new SomeClass();

echo SomeClassAdapter::getInstanceProperty($i); // 1
echo SomeClassAdapter::runInstanceMethod($i); // 'hello' 
```

That way your code does not depend on Reflection, is easy to parse(read) for your IDE and allows extendability for
future changes.

### Class Overrider

Now, let's take a look at the bigger guns, shall we? How about cases where you need/want to extend
the functionality of a class, or hook into an existing process, without forking the whole package,
but everything is `final` and `private`? In that case the only solution will be to modify
the actual code of the class in order to break them open. The Class Overrider is a runtime tool
that lets you do exactly that; override classes in an automagical way.

#### Installation

The installation is easy(ish), but you have to know the application you work with.

1. You need to know a location where we can **securely** store compiled php classes. (Writable directory outside the
   docroot)
2. You want to configure your overrides as soon as possible in the lifecycle of your application in order to get the
   most out of this feature.
3. Your application needs to run using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

For example in a Symfony application I would suggest doing this at the TOP of the "boot" method in your Kernel.
As a storage location I would suggest the app's "var" directory and preferably in a sub-directory
like `/var/classOverrides` (**cough** or use the [Symfony bundle](https://github.com/Neunerlei/lockpick-bundle))

```php
<?php

use Neunerlei\Lockpick\Override\ClassOverrider;

// First you need to register the class overrider for your application
ClassOverrider::init(
    // You need to provide an autoloader, which can be either done completely manually,
    // or using the "makeAutoLoaderByStoragePath" factory.
    ClassOverrider::makeAutoLoaderByStoragePath(
        // The first parameter is the absolute path to the directory where we can put some PRIVATE PHP FILEs
        // This directory MUST be writable by the webserver, but MUST NEVER be readable to the outside world!
        __DIR__.'/var/classOverrides',
        // The second parameter is the composer autoloader, which you can acquire by "requiring" the
        // autoload.php file from the vendor directory. There is no harm in doing this multiple times,
        // so it will work fine, even if composer was already loaded earlier. 
        require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php'
    )
);
```

If you run your application (or refresh the page), and everything still works without any issue, you are good to go.

#### Usage

After you installed the Class Overrider in your application you have to consider two rules:

1. make sure the class you want to overwrite is not already loaded via auto-loader or direct include
2. your class has to be loadable using composer's auto-load functionality

If your class matches the criteria you can call the overrider in your code like so;
Imagine you have a class like this, which comes from a third-party package:

```php
<?php
namespace ForeignVendor\ForeignNamespace;
final class TargetClass {
    public function foo(){
        // Returns interesting stuff
        return 'foo';
    }

    private function privateBar() {
        // Does fancy stuff
    }
}
```

To extend the class, you first have to create a new class somewhere in your code, that's your extension.
The location and namespace is up to you, the only thing you need to do is to extend the SpecialParentClassâ„¢.

Said SpecialParentClassâ„¢ WILL BE (after you did all the steps described) GENERATED for you based on the name of
the class you want to override.

So for our example: `ForeignVendor\ForeignNamespace\TargetClass`,
the SpecialParentClassâ„¢ will be called `ForeignVendor\ForeignNamespace\LockpickClassOverrideTargetClass` instead.
The `LockpickClassOverride` part will be the prefix of every generated class.

**IMPORTANT: The SpecialParentClassâ„¢ will probably not exist when you create your extension class, so you can't rely on
your IDE's autocompletion there. However, it will be there when the code tries to access it**

```php
<?php
namespace YourVendor\YourNamespace;
use ForeignVendor\ForeignNamespace\LockpickClassOverrideTargetClass;
class ExtendedTargetClass extends LockpickClassOverrideTargetClass {
    public function foo(?bool $useExtension = null){
        // Use private members of the parent without problems
        $this->privateBar();
        
        // You can implement your own features
        if($useExtension !== false){
            return 'bar';
        }
        
        // Or can call the parent implementation without problems 
        return parent::foo();
    }
}
```

After that, you can call the Class Overrider somewhere in your code, BEFORE the actual implementation is included.
I would suggest configuring the overrider near-ish to where you called `ClassOverrider::init`.

```php
<?php
use Neunerlei\Lockpick\Override\ClassOverrider;

use ForeignVendor\ForeignNamespace\TargetClass;
use YourVendor\YourNamespace\ExtendedTargetClass;

ClassOverrider::registerOverride(TargetClass::class, ExtendedTargetClass::class);
```

Now you are able to create an instance of the class as if nothing happened:

```php
<?php

use ForeignVendor\ForeignNamespace\TargetClass;
$i = new TargetClass();
```

However, even if it looks like `TargetClass` it does not entirely quack like `TargetClass` anymore.
The magic already took place, and you did not even notice it; If you do `echo $i->foo()` the result will now be "bar"
instead of "foo". The autoloader (Resp. the OverrideStackResolver) added two files for you:

- First; the "clone", or as I call it SpecialParentClassâ„¢, basically a carbon copy of `TargetClass` but with all
  properties, methods and constants converted to "protected" (if they were private before). The "final" modifier was
  also removed from the class or methods signatures.
- Second; the "alias" which creates an empty husk with name `ForeignVendor\ForeignNamespace\TargetClass` that extends
  your own extension class.

With that in place, every part of the code will now use your implementation/extension instead of the original class.

#### Installation part 2 - or how to get rid of the copies

Because we are generating actual files on the drive and reuse them over and over to avoid performance issues,
you probably want to delete the built files whenever they were updated.

I would suggest to do that either on composer install/update or whenever your framework clears its caches.

After you initialized the Overrider, call the `ClassOverrider::flushStorage();` method to remove all compiled class
copies.

#### Caveats

- The extended class is a modified copy of the original class, so your IDE shift-click will not work as expected.
- You will see the extended classes and the copied class names instead of the original class in logs and backtraces.
- Only works for classes that follow the PSR-4 guideline with a single class per file
- Can cause issues if you are using PHP preloading (especially in Symfony), you need to remove all classes found
  in `ClassOverrider::getNotPreloadableClasses();` somehow, depending on your framework
